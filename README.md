## 🎯 Learning Goal
The long-term goal is to transition into an **AI-related engineering role**, focusing on:
- Python-based data processing
- Applied machine learning
- AI-enabled applications (not theory-heavy research)

## 📚 Learning Progress
### Day 1–2: Python Fundamentals
- Variables, data types
- Control flow (`if`, `while`, `for`)
- Lists and dictionaries
- Functions and basic input/output

---

### Day 3: Student Management System (Procedural Version)
**Folder:** `Day03-Student-Management-System`

- Built a CLI-based student management system
- Implemented:
  - Add / view / search / delete students
  - JSON-based data persistence
  - CSV export
- Focus: understanding program flow and data handling

---

### Day 4: Student Management System (OOP Refactor)
**Folder:** `Day04-Student-Management-System`

- Refactored the entire system into an **object-oriented design**
- Introduced a `StudentManager` class to encapsulate:
  - Data storage
  - Business logic
  - File operations
- Improvements:
  - Clear separation of concerns (`main.py` vs core logic)
  - More maintainable and extensible structure
  - Safer file path handling using `__file__`

This marks the transition from *“scripts”* to *“small software systems”*.
